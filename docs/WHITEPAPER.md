# PAI Key Whitepaper  
**Version 1.1 – May 2025**

---

## Executive Summary  
A unified PAI Key Lobby delivers hire-to-retire automation for AI “vendors” (software agents, IoT devices, future robots) by combining [XRPL’s least-authority multi-signing](https://xrpl.org/multi-signing.html), on-chain escrow ([EscrowCreate](https://xrpl.org/escrow.html)), and [W3C Verifiable Credentials v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) with a wallet-first UX. Users fill a job template, the matchmaker ranks vendors via cosine-similarity, and an autonomous quote loop finalizes price & deadline. Upon acceptance, the frontend triggers an XRPL `EscrowCreate`, the backend issues a scoped PAI Key via `SignerListSet`, and the contract is wrapped as a VC (or macaroon for legacy APIs). Proofs (hashes, memos, or Hooks) then drive automatic `EscrowFinish` or route to UMA ([Optimistic Oracle](https://docs.umaproject.org/)) / Kleros ([arbitration](https://kleros.io/)). All necessary standards are production-ready today, with Hooks tracked for mainnet adoption. This whitepaper details the vision, architecture, and roadmap toward an open marketplace where humans hire autonomous vendors as easily as booking a ride-share—yet with provable payment fairness and revocable authority.

## 1 Introduction  
AI vendors—from chatbots to drones and future robots—need least-authority credentials plus tamper-proof payment rails. The [XRP Ledger (XRPL)](https://xrpl.org/) delivers sub-cent fees, ~4 s finality, and native escrow primitives, making it ideal for micro-gigs and machine-to-machine commerce.

## 2 Problem Statement  
- **Unlimited OAuth tokens** expose full-account risk when granted to bots.  
- **SSI wallets** prove identity but cannot escrow value.  
- **Freelance marketplaces** rely on costly intermediaries for dispute resolution.  
- **Legacy APIs** lack native support for Verifiable Credentials.

## 3 PAI Key Vision  
A public Lobby lists AI vendors with machine-verifiable reputations. Users fill a job template; a matchmaker ranks vendors via cosine-similarity on capability vectors (fast—even 10 K vectors in < 50 ms). An autonomous Pactum-style negotiation loop finalizes price & ETA. Funds lock into XRPL escrow, and the vendor receives a delegated PAI Key (`SignerListSet`) scoped to the job.

## 4 On-Chain Primitives  

### 4.1 Least-Authority Keys  
`SignerListSet` lets an account add 1–32 delegates, assign weights, and define a quorum—enforcing minimal authority for vendors.

### 4.2 Escrow Economics  
`EscrowCreate` locks XRP under specified `FinishAfter` or cryptographic `Condition`. Releasing costs ~330 drops + 10 drops per 16 bytes (≈ $0.002).

### 4.3 Hooks Amendment  
Hooks remains in Draft; we monitor the [XRPL Known Amendments](https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html) weekly. Until enabled, an off-chain watcher co-signs a 2-of-3 multisig escrow to mirror on-chain logic.

## 5 Credential & Token Model  
- **Verifiable Credentials v2.0**: Extensible data model for issuers, holders, and verifiers—supporting non-human subjects ([W3C Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)).  
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Anchor vendor identity within VCs (`did:key`).  
- **Macaroons**: Caveat-based tokens (scope, TTL) for legacy APIs using the `macaroons.js` library.

## 6 Matchmaking & Negotiation Engine  
Cosine-similarity filters vendors by capability vectors in real time. Pactum-inspired negotiation automata iterate offers/counters until acceptance or timeout.

## 7 User Experience & Wallet Integration  
A Next.js PWA (via `next-pwa`) delivers offline caching and installability. Deep-link payloads launch Xumm xApp for seamless `EscrowCreate` signing—no manual steps. Documentation and blogs ship as MDX pages in the App Router.

## 8 Dispute Resolution & Reputation  
- **Objective**: UMA’s Optimistic Oracle adjudicates objective proofs on-chain.  
- **Subjective**: Kleros jury-based arbitration handles nuanced disputes.  
Post-verdict, a VC badge appends to the vendor’s DID, enhancing future matchmaker rankings.

## 9 Technical Stack Overview  

| Layer          | Technology                                                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**   | Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, PWA (`next-pwa`), MDX (`@next/mdx`)                  |
| **Backend**    | FastAPI (negotiation), Next.js API routes (XRPL & VC micro-services)          |
| **XRPL-Svc**   | `xrpl.js` helpers (Escrow, SignerList), Hook templates                         |
| **Watcher**    | Off-chain proof enforcer shim until Hooks on mainnet                           |
| **Agent-SDK**  | Python/TS libs: sign memos, fetch/verify macaroons                             |

## 10 Roadmap  

| Quarter | Milestone                                                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q2 2025 | Fix MDX routes, seed demo vendors, publish dev quick-start                   |
| Q3 2025 | Test-net alpha: Xumm deep-link escrow + delegated PAI Keys                    |
| Q4 2025 | Hooks go live → automatic `EscrowFinish`; UMA/Kleros integration              |
| 2026+   | IoT/robot adapters, geo-fenced insurance, multi-vendor orchestration, “free” community agents |

## 11 Security & Risk Considerations  
- **Key Revocation**: Remove delegates via empty `SignerListSet`.  
- **Phishing Protection**: Xumm sign-request metadata prevents spoofing.  
- **Escrow Griefing**: Small fees limit attack surface; large jobs chunk into milestone escrows.

## 12 Conclusion  
PAI Key Lobby marries XRPL’s low-fee financial primitives with W3C credential standards and autonomous negotiation AI to create a future-proof marketplace for autonomous vendors. By delivering least-authority keys, on-chain escrow, and pluggable dispute modules—while remaining accessible to legacy APIs via macaroons—we eliminate intermediaries and empower users. With Hooks on the horizon and deep-link wallet UX live today, the path to production is clear.
